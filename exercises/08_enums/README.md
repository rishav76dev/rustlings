# Enums

Rust allows you to define types called "enums" which enumerate possible values.
Enums are a feature in many languages, but their capabilities differ in each language. Rustâ€™s enums are most similar to algebraic data types in functional languages, such as F#, OCaml, and Haskell.
Useful in combination with enums is Rust's "pattern matching" facility, which makes it easy to run different code for different values of an enumeration.

there are two kind of ip addressses v4,v6

enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
IpAddrKind is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.

Enum Values
We can create instances of each of the two variants of IpAddrKind like this:

    let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;

Enums can be passed to functions:

fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

we can call this function with either variant:


    route(IpAddrKind::V4);
    route(IpAddrKind::V6);
